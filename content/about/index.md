A dynamic and visionary **Product & Growth Generalist** with over five years of hands-on expertise, I, Harsh, specialize in the meticulous craft of scaling innovative products within the vibrant industries of **SaaS**, **e-Commerce**, and the nascent **Web3** sector. My enriched professional journey is a testament to my deep-seated knowledge in driving multi-channel product development and marketing strategies that spark **user engagement, enhance brand visibility, and bolster sustainable growth.**

Fluency in a diverse set of tools underpins the dexterity of my skill set. I adeptly wield design instruments like ***Figma*** and ***Webflow*** for crafting intuitive wireframes and interactive prototypes, leveraging these blueprints to communicate visionary concepts and streamline user experiences. My proficiency with ***Miro*** and ***Canva*** facilitates the collaborative distillation of ideas and the creation of compelling visual narratives, while my comfort with technical tools such as ***SQL***, ***PowerBi***, and ***Postman*** reinforces my capacity to gather, analyze, and act on data-driven insights.

In the realm of growth, data, and analytics, I harness the power of platforms like ***Mixpanel***, ***Google Analytics***, ***Google Data Studio***, ***Amplitude***, ***Segment***, and ***Clevertap***. These analytical arsenals enable me to meticulously track and interpret user behaviour, thereby constructing robust growth models and highly targeted marketing campaigns.

My marketing acumen is further sharpened by hands-on experience with ***Facebook Ads Manager***, ***Google Ads***, ***Similarweb***, and ***SEMRush***, equipping me with the ability to optimize search engine presence and manage ad campaigns with precision and effectiveness. The use of Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets rounds out my analytical toolkit, allowing for sophisticated data manipulation and decision support.

As a strategist, I thrive on developing well-positioned product roadmaps and price strategies, taking into account competitive landscapes to ensure market relevance and success. I possess a comprehensive understanding of product positioning, informed by substantial market research and competitive analysis. My approach is deeply rooted in project management principles, ensuring that initiatives remain on track and within scope.

My commitment to product excellence and market fit involves iterating on **minimum viable products (MVPs)** with a laser focus on refining product features through a synergetic collaboration with marketing, design, and technology teams. The development of product automation strategies and micro-product ideation is at the heart of my efforts to enhance customer experiences and streamline operation efficiencies.

Throughout my career, I have emphasized the importance of customer experience marketing, orchestrating user interviews, surveys, and segmentation to refine onboarding processes and user journeys. This attention to detail is evident in my success in elevating sign-up rates and monthly recurring revenue (MRR). My contributions have also yielded substantial increases in weekly active users (WAU), reflecting a deep understanding of what drives user engagement and retention.

My endeavors in social media marketing and community engagement strategies underscore my commitment to building strong relationships with users, fostering an environment of trust and brand loyalty. As I chart the course for growth and success in the digital space, I bring with me the tools, skills, and passion necessary to turn innovative ideas into reality.

##I'm always left spellbound by the remarkable talent out there and the amazing innovations people come up with. If our paths have crossed, rest assured, I've probably taken a tour of your website and thought to myself, 'Now that's some top-notch work!' And, yes, I'm forever on the lookout to expand my library – my reading list is forever growing.

***I dream of making a TON of money with computers and then possibly never touching a computer ever again, hehe jk. I prefer cold days, drink tea & listen to music every day.***
