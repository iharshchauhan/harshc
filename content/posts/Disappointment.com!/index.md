Remember when the internet was just cat videos and memes? Now, it’s like an awkward family reunion with my online ‘relatives’ – always expecting something, always disappointed. It’s a classic case of, ‘Back in my day, we didn’t need approval from internet strangers.’ But here we are, getting unsolicited advice like, ‘Do this, not that’ or ‘Don’t get offended.’ Like, can’t we all just vibe in our own lanes?.

Spoiler alert: Your expectation of me being someone else is your circus to manage, not mine. Me? I’m just here, keeping it 100 and expecting nothing less than authenticity. “Why not join me in the chill zone?”. I could hope for you to mind your own business, but you might be too busy being the self-appointed guardian of internet manners.
