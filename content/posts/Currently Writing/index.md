As traditional learning environments were disrupted, there arose an unprecedented reliance on digital platforms, catalyzing a period of intense growth and innovation in the Edtech sector. This has compelled both established entities and emerging challengers to continuously re-evaluate and realign their offerings with the evolving market demands and technological advances.
